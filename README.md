# Speckle Filtering and Flattening Example

Simple console app showing how to flatten and filter Speckle objects. This is a companion repo for the [tutorial on Speckle's developer docs page](https://speckle.guide/dev/FilteringData.html).

## Running 

If using vscode, simply press "F5" and that should start a debugging instance. Otherwise, from the command line, `dotnet run` should do the trick as well.
